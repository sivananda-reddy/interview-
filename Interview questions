1). How to extern a below variable.
    Static int a = 10;

Ans.extern int a = 10;
    //extern static int a = 10;

SW6#sh mac address-table
 
      	Mac Address Table
-------------------------------------------.

3). Int a = 10;
    Char *p = &a;
    Print *p == ?
Ans. ‘\n’

4).can arp go to another vlan?
5).TCP/IP round trip time calcaulation?

VVDN Technologies, kochin
 

q).Where static variables are stored?
q).why structure padding ? how to avoid it ?
q).how can i copy 10byte of string to char a[10] ? 
   if not How to make it possible?
q).how can i store 25 byte character string into char *p = malloc(10) ?
   If any challanges, what are they? How do we fix it ?
   NOTE:strncpy 
q).how do you store pointer to a int variable ? 
   Is it right one?
   If yes, how do we access pointer address from int? 

*q).in f1, we declare structure variable sv , if we pass sv to f2 how do we 
      Access sv in f2 to print sv data ?

q).can we pass structure variable to another function?

q).if i open mulitple google tabs in my web browser, how each tabs will 
   Work well particular to their individual search ?

q)Will router pass/forward/route broadcast address(255.255.255.255) packet ? if no, why? If yes, in which use case?
ans). Yes in this case. When we assign/config router/switch to dhcp relay, at this scenario router forwards packet to required path to get ip address. 
q).What is the mistake on 127.0.0.1 loopback address?
ans). 127.0.0.1 - comes in Class A address, hence we can’t assign 127 range address to any device, so we indirectly lost some ip’s for assigning this 127 range class A address to loopback address.
Eg: ipv4 → 127.x.x.x is a loopback address, but in ipv6  → ::1 (learnt lesson by ipv4 mistake)
